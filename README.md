This project has a website explaining it all (in French), see it live at [https://jedef.github.io/LTM](https://jedef.github.io/LTM).

In `website`, you'll find the sources for the website and live data visualization.

In `data_manipulation`, there are python notebooks that were used to process the result of the OCR of the directories.
