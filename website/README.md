# Lausanne Time Machine - Groupe Grancy

## Website

(maintainer: [@jedef](https://github.com/jedef))

Project code is in `https://github.com/jedef/LTM/tree/main/docs` and website is published on `https://jedef.github.io/LTM/`.

This website (src in `docs`) runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is hosted on GitHub pages. Once installed, you can run the local Jekyll server with `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the `docs` directory.

The script `annuairecsvTogeoJSON.py` is used to transform the exported csv files to a format usable by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), for the interactive map.
