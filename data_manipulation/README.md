## Data manipulation

(maintainer: [@Ant-One](github.com/Ant-One))

This is the code for data manipulation. In the `1923` and `1951` directories, you'll find the Interactive Pyton notebooks (you can run them with [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)). 

`1923.xlsx` and `1951.xlsx` are the row files extracted with an OCR program and extracted with [Inception](https://inception-project.github.io/)

`1923_index_street_cat_jobs.csv` and `1951_index_street_cat_jobs.csv` are the final ouputs of the notebooks, with some manual processing and review already done (basically reading 10k lines of csv).

The notebooks need [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to process data.
